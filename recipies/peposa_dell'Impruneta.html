        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The story goes that terracotta tile workers in Impruneta, Tuscany, would place this stew into clay pots and cook it in their still-hot kilns overnight where it would be ready in the morning. They used a lot of pepper because the meat was not always top quality. The amount of pepper is up to you--I used a ridiculous amount, but even so it wasn't overpowering.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 beef short ribs (8 to 10 oz. each)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>8 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns, freshly crushed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 sage leaves</li>
            <li>3 small sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 cups red wine, preferably Chianti</li>
            <li>salt to taste, to adjust sauce</li>
        </ul>
